## The mission

In the current times, we are all seeing a rise in online shopping.  
Some shops however could use a bit of help.  
You can choose if you want to rework an existing online shop, or create one from scratch.  
 
The main goal of this workshop is to create a visually appealing store page.

## Installing tailwind.css

The first step to installing tailwind.css is to make sure you have node npm installed.
> use `npm --version` to verify that you have npm installed on your pc  
>

To instal tailwind.css fully you will need to go through a few steps.  
You can link a stylesheet as we tend to do with bootstrap, this comes at a loss of some functionalities, an example of this is setting up custom colors.   
In today's workshop we will go over the full set up, with instructions so you can look it up again should you want to try it in the future.  
  
#### Installation steps:
  
  1. Make your repository/folder
  2. Set up your basic files, index.html and your css file, this can be done later as well.  
  3. In your root folder, open your terminal and type the following code:`npm init -y` this should create a package.json.
  4. Once the package.json is made we instal tailwind using `npm instal tailwindcss`.
